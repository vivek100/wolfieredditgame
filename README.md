**Draw, Guess, and Laugh Your Way to the Top!**

Pixelary is a fun and interactive drawing and guessing game where you can compete with friends and other players to earn points, unlock rewards, and rise up the leaderboard.

## How to Earn Points

- **Drawers**

  - **10 points** for posting a drawing
  - **1 point** for each correct guess made by others

- **Guessers**
  - **2 points** for each correct guess
  - **Bonus**: **10 extra points** for being the first to guess correctly

As you accumulate points, you’ll automatically level up and unlock exciting perks. Keep an eye on your progress by checking the progress bar in the pinned post in the community!
